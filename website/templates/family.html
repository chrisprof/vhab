        </div>
        <p class="Tittle-text">Knowing someone who has an addiction is not uncommon, but knowing the best way to help a loved one with an addiction can be confusing and even scary. When someone has an addiction, it can affect every aspect of their lives as well as the lives of their loved ones. You will inevitably be concerned about your loved one, and it can be difficult to know what to do and what not to do, but it’s important to remember that Recovery is a solution</p>

        <h2 class="do-dont-container-head">The Dos and Don’ts of Helping a Loved One With an Addiction</h2>
            <div class="do-dont-subheading">
                <p class="Para-text">Once you’ve noticed the signs of addiction in your loved one — like an Alcohol Addiction or an Opioid Addiction, for example — you’ll need to know how to talk to and treat them in a way that is positive and helpful. There are several ways to do this, some easy to practice and others that require a little more effort and understanding on your part. Here are a few dos and don’ts for helping a loved one deal with addiction:</p>

            <div class = "do-dont-content-right">
                <h3 class="do-dont-subheading one">Do: Have Compassion</h3>
                <p class="Para-text">Addiction is a disease. Normally, we wouldn’t fault someone with a physical disease, like diabetes or cancer — instead, we would likely be compassionate and willing to help them survive their illness. Addiction deserves the same compassion and understanding. Recognize that addiction isn’t a character flaw or a choice, but rather a disease. </p>
                <p class="Para-text">It’s also crucial to understand there may be external factors that encourage an addiction, like stress or mental illness. Addiction is often a coping mechanism for stress, providing temporary relief. The fleetingness of the relief may contribute to repeatedly seeking out potentially destructive habits that develop over time into an Alcohol or Opioid Addiction</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "do-dont-content-left">
                <h3 class="do-dont-subheading one">Don’t: Shame or Criticize</h3>
                <p class="Para-text">Human nature sometimes forces us to shift the blame because it’s easier to understand a problem if we know its source. But the cause of addictions isn’t so black and white, so there’s never really just one thing to blame. Most importantly, the person with the addiction is not at fault for the disease.</p>
                <p class="Para-text">Avoid implying or outright stating that your loved one is to blame for their addiction. Shaming or criticizing a family member who is struggling with an Alcohol Addiction or an Opioid Addiction is often counterproductive to their Recovery. While tough love may have a small part in helping an alcoholic spouse, this is not the place for it</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "do-dont-content-right">
                <h3 class="do-dont-subheading one">Do: Expect Difficulties</h3>
                <p class="Para-text">Rehabilitation can be difficult — for you or your loved one. There are many reasons a person may be reluctant to seek treatment, including:</p> <br />
                <ul class="Para-text">
                    <li class="List-items"><b>Shame:</b> They may feel like they will be looked down on or endanger their jobs and relationships by admitting to having an addiction</li>
                    <li class="List-items"><b>Stigma:</b> Unfortunately, there is still a lot of stigma around diseases of the brain, like addiction and various mental illnesses, and your loved one may be unable or unwilling to expose themselves to it</li>
                    <li class="List-items"><b>Denial:</b> Someone with an addiction may not be willing or able to admit that they have an addiction at all, let alone consider treatment</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="Para-text">There is also the risk of relapse, which can become a cloud of dread over you and your loved one. While it’s always a possibility, it’s hardly helpful to focus on it. Instead, focus on building positivity and encouragement.</p>
            </div>

            <div class = "do-dont-content-left">
                <h3 class="do-dont-subheading one">Don’t: Expect Immediate Change</h3>
                <p class="Para-text">How do you help an alcoholic? One of the best ways is to be realistic in your expectations. Long-term Recovery is not a quick fix. It’s an ongoing process for your loved one that takes time, effort and continued support from professionals and family alike. Some treatments may work for some time and then need to be changed.</p>
                <p class="Para-text">If one treatment doesn’t work, it doesn’t mean all treatments will fail. It just means you’ll have to find the specific one that will work for your loved one.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="do-dont-block">
                <div class = "do-dont-content-right">
                    <h3 class="do-dont-subheading one">Do: Educate Yourself</h3>
                    <p class="Para-text">Knowledge is power, and educating yourself on addiction and treatment is a benefit when learning how to help someone with an addiction. If you’re wondering how to help an alcoholic son, research alcoholism. Learn about the symptoms of an Alcohol Addiction as well as the treatments available. Educate yourself on the specific type of Recovery that your son is in, so you can better understand what he is going through and what sort of help he is receiving.</p>
                    <p class="Para-text">It’s also useful to learn about addiction in general, finding out the answers to questions like:</p>
                    <ul class="Para-text">
                        <li class="List-items"><b> What is addiction </b></li>
                        <li class="List-items"><b> How does addiction occur </b></li>
                        <li class="List-items"><b> Why do some people become addicted </b></li>
                        <li class="List-items"><b> How is addiction treated? What are the different treatment options? </b></li>
                        <li class="List-items"><b> What is a holistic therapy, and how does it work? </b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="Para-text">The more you know, the better you’ll understand what is going on and be able to better help your loved on.</p>

                </div>
                
                <div class = "do-dont-content-left">
                    <h3 class="do-dont-subheading one">Don’t: Enable Your Loved One</h3>
                    <p class="Para-text">There can be a fine line between helping someone with an addiction and enabling them. Sometimes when we think we’re protecting a loved one from the consequences of their addiction, we are actually enabling them to continue with potentially destructive behavior</p>
                    <p class="Para-text">For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to help an alcoholic, keeping them from drinking and driving is helpful, since that could put them and others in danger. However, consistently offering to drive them home whenever they get too intoxicated is enabling their actions, because it’s setting up a formula in which you are constantly available to rescue them. Studies show that people with addictions are more likely to proactively seek treatment when they are forced to face the consequences of their actions</p>

                <div class="Big-Tittle-Wrap">

                    </div>
                    <p class="Tittle-text-out">Part of learning how to help an alcoholic loved one is knowing what treatments are available. Another part you may not have considered is what you can expect once they begin treatment. You may end up experiencing the gamut of emotions, all of which are normal, such as:</p>
                    <ul class="Para-text-out">
                        <li class="List-items-out"><b>Relief:</b> You may be glad your loved one is finally getting treatment and comforted to know that your loved one is physically in a safe space.</li>
                        <li class="List-items-out"><b>Anxiety:</b> They may feel like they will be looked down on or endanger their jobs and relationships by admitting to having an addiction</li>
                        <li class="List-items-out"><b>Anger:</b> You may worry about the well-being of your loved one and whether they’re getting the help they need.</li>
                        <li class="List-items-out"><b>Sadness:</b> Feeling bad for your loved one and their struggles is a sign of empathy and compassion. Sadness doesn’t necessarily mean pity, either.</li>
                    </ul>
